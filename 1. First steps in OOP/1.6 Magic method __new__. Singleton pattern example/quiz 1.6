quiz questions in this lesson:

1.  At what point is the __new__() magic method called?
    >> just before the class object is created

2.  What must the __new__() magic method return to successfully create class objects?
    >> address of the newly created object

3.  The class constructor (__new__ method) can be written with the following signature:

    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs): ...

    What role does the first parameter cls play here?
    >> reference to the class for which the object is being created

4.  In what order are the __new__() class constructor and __init__()
    initializer called when the class object is created?
    >> the __new__() method is always called first, then the __init__() method

5.  When overriding the __new__() method, the object is created by the super().__new__(cls) command:

    def __new__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
    return super().__new__(cls)

    Choose the correct statement to explain it.
    >> There is a call to the base class from which the constructor is called - the __new__(cls)
    method with the cls argument - references to the current class
