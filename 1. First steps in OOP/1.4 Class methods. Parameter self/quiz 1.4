quiz questions in this lesson:

1.  What is a class method?
    >> Any (non-static) function declared inside a class

2.  What are class attributes?
    >> Variables and method names (references to methods) of a class

3.  What role does the self parameter play in class methods?
    >> is a reference to the class object from which the method was called

4.  There is the following class:

    class Stepik:
        def next_task(self):
            return 'Next task'

    And an object of this class is created:

    my_st = stepik()

    Select all correct options for calling the next_task() method

    >> Stepik.next_task(my_st)
    >> my_st.next_task()

5.  The class is declared in the program:

    class String:
        is_empty = False

    And then two instances of it are created:

    s1 = String()
    s2 = String()

    After that, the command is executed:

    s2.is_empty = True

    Select the correct statements related to this program.
    >> The variable a = s1.is_empty will refer to the is_empty attribute of the String class
    >> The variable b = s2.is_empty will refer to the local attribute is_empty of the object s2
    >> s1.is_empty will still be False and s2.is_empty will be new True
    >> The last command will create a local property is_empty with a value of True on the s2 instance
