# Declare a class named Goods and add the following attributes (variables) to it:
#
# title: 'Ice Cream'
# weight: 154
# tp: 'Food'
# price: 1024
#
# Then, after declaring the class, change its price attribute to 2048 and add another attribute:
#
# inflation: 100


class Goods:
    title = "Ice Cream"
    weight = 154
    tp = "Food"
    price = 1024


Goods.price = 2048
Goods.inflation = 100
